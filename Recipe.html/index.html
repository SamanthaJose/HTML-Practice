<h3> <b>Ingredients for Apple Pie</b></h3>
<ul>
    <li> <b>Pie Pastry:</b> Start with a <a href="https://www.spendwithpennies.com/flaky-homemade-pie-crust/">double crust pastry</a>, or use a store-bought or frozen crust. </li>
    <li> <b>Apples:</b> I love Granny Smiths for their tartness, but any firm apple will do. Feel free to mix apple types.</li>
    <li> <b>Sugar:</b> Adjust based on your apples and taste preference. </li>
    <li> <b>Flour:</b> Helps thicken any juices from the apples in the filling. </li>
    <li> <b>Warm Spices:</b> Cinnamon or <a href="https://www.spendwithpennies.com/apple-pie-spice/">apple pie spice</a> are the perfect addition to apple pie. </li>
</ul>

<h4> <b>How to Make Apple Pie</b></h4>
<ol>
    <li> <b>Prep Apples- </b> To make apple pie filling, peel the apples and slice them between 1/4″-1/8″ thick. Toss them with sugar, spices, and flour per the recipe below.</li>
    <li> <b>Roll Pie Crust- </b> If you made homemade pie dough, roll it into a 12-inch circle (1/8 inch thick) and line a 9-inch pie plate.</li>
    <li> <b>Fill & Bake- </b> Fill the crust with the apple mixture and top with a second crust (or a <a href="https://www.spendwithpennies.com/how-to-make-a-lattice-crust/">lattice crust</a>) and bake.</li>
